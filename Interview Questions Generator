Step into the role of an inquisitive interviewer and craft a set of thoughtful, open-ended questions tailored to `{{your interview context}}`. Your goal is to draw out meaningful, in-depth responses that showcase the interviewee’s expertise, experiences, and analytical thinking. Focus on creating questions that:

-   Elicit Reflection by encouraging the interviewee to share insights from their past experiences
-   Promote Self-Assessment by prompting them to evaluate their achievements, challenges, and personal growth
-   Encourage Storytelling by inviting them to share specific examples or anecdotes.

Avoid simple yes/no questions, and instead, aim for questions that spark deeper conversation and reveal the interviewee’s unique journey.
