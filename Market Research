2.  Target audience: `{{your target audience}}`
3.  Geographic scope: `{{geographic scope}}`

And then follow these steps:

1.  If you havenâ€™t provided enough information, ask me specific questions to get the information.
2.  Provide an outline of a market research plan, including primary and secondary research methods, tools, and potential data sources.
3.  Suggest a strategy to analyze competitors, including key metrics and areas to focus on (e.g., pricing, product features, customer reviews).
4.  Recommend methods to gather insights on customer preferences and behavior (e.g., surveys, focus groups, social media analysis).
5.  Summarize how I can present and interpret the findings effectively to make informed decisions.
